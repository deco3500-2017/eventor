                        An application focused on connecting social gatherings to potential attendees who may be
                        interested in those events but can’t find them due to not having the right platform or simply
                        because they are new to that community and have no connections. Our application’s goal is to 
                        ease the user’s process of finding events by filtering them based on user’s location and interest.

                        or manually find one from social media. What if we don’t have connections in that 
                        community and can’t find those events?
