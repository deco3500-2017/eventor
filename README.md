<h1>Eventor</h1>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<h3>1.1Problem</h3>
In this day and age, smartphones and mobile applications have become a daily necessity in everyday life. Smartphone users would often rely on these mobile applications ranging from communication use to organisation use. This includes finding events for their recreational needs. However, often times people find it hard to find events that they like because of limited platforms that provides such information. Even social media platforms that do provide this often times does not give accurate results.

This becomes an inconvenience especially now that everything is fast-paced and instantaneous. In a world where everything is easily reachable with a touch of a screen, what makes an application stand out from its competitors is its ability to give the most easiest and comfortable service. And that is exactly what Eventor would like to achieve. Not only does Eventor suggests events based on the user’s location but it also filters out events in regards to the user’s interest so that they only get recommendation of events that they like. It is an application solely focused on connecting local social gatherings to potential attendees who are interested in those events but cannot find them due to not having the proper platform or merely because they do not know anyone in that community.

<h3>2.1 Aim</h3>

<h3>2.2 Audience</h3>

<h3>2.3 Difference between competitors</h3>

Competitors that our team has found related to our project are the applications Facebook Events and EventBrite.

| Eventor        | EventBrite             | Facebook Events  |
| -------------- |------------------------| -----------------|
| Suggestions of events are organized by the user's interest and location. User's will not be suggested events that they are not interested in and that are not in range with their current location.      | Suggestions of events are organized by type of event. User will need to scroll through events that they have no interest in.          | Suggestions are only organized by location. Often times people are pushed to scroll through events that they don't necessarily like or they're not interested in just to find a correct event. |
| Interactive chat group will be automatically available for the user once they have selected 'Interested'. This chat group will be between the user and the event's host which will help with 'ice breaking' especially if the user is a newbie.   | There is no chat group.  |  There is a wall post for user to post in but is less personal. Personal chat messaging is only available if the user selects it. |
| Location of the event is only made available once the user's request to attend is accepted to ensure security. This is extremely helpful for events that are considerably small. | Location of the event is made available for everyone.    | Location of the event is made available for everyone.    |
| Interests can be updated whenever the user wants to ensure flexibility. | This option is not made available.     | This option is not made available.    |
| The choice to accept or decline a user's request to attend the event. This will help hosts of smaller events to keep track of who's coming and be in complete control. This will also help the application to give accurate suggestions and prioritize certain events for the user based on the user's history.  | This option is not available.              | This option is not available.         |

<h2>Communication</h2>

Communication between members and task organisation will be done primarily through platforms such as Slack and Github. In Slack, we will uphold good communication among members of our team by using it as a platform to discuss problems or ideas pertaining our project. We will also use Slack as to constantly to deliver constructive feedback amongst team members about our/their work. If necessary, further deliberation will be done in our meeting which is held during our designated two-hour workshop held each Tuesday.

If conflict or disagreements arises in the group, we will do the following:
1. Discuss those problems, conflict, agreements as a team through Slack. If the problem persists that it requires a group meetup, the problem will be discussed either in the Workshop scheduled (every Tuesday) or at an agreed meetup location outside of class.
2. Discussions should yield an agreed consensus/solution.
3. Discussions should be documented through Slack.

If disagreements still cannot be resolved,
1. The team leader will be the one to make the decision for the team.

If it is still unresolved,
1. The team leader will consult with the tutor or the course staff who are available for advice and guidance.
2. If necessary, peer assessment will be requested.

File sharing will primarily be done through Github for version control as it is easy for us to keep track of all the changes done to our files and by whom those changes were done.
