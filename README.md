<h1>Eventor</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h6>Problem</h6>
Often times people find it hard to find events that they like because of limited platforms that provides such information. Social media platform that does provide this often times does not categorize these events and therefore, events provided are often cluttered and people would need to search for the events they like manually by scrolling through many other events.

<h2>Concept</h2>

<h6>Difference between competitors</h6>

Competitors that our team has found related to our project are the applications Facebook Events and EventBrite.

<h2>Communication</h2>

Communication between members and task organisation will be done primarily through platforms such as Slack and Github. In Slack, we will uphold good communication among members of our team by using it as a platform to discuss problems or ideas pertaining our project. We will also use Slack as to constantly to deliver constructive feedback amongst team members about our/their work. If necessary, further deliberation will be done in our meeting which is held during our designated two-hour workshop held each Tuesday. However, if there are disagreements that cannot be resolved by communication using those means we will ask for advice from the course staff or course tutors who are available.

File sharing will primarily be done through Github for version control as it is easy for us to keep track of all the changes done to our files and by whom those changes were done.
