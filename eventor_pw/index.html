              <h2>YOUR PERSONAL EVENT LOCATOR</h2>
              <p>An application solely focused on connecting local social gatherings to potential attendees who are interested in those events but can’t find them due to not having the proper platform or merely because they don’t know anyone in that community.</p>

              <h2>Why eventor has been designed?</h2>
              <p>It’s hard to find community events or social gatherings that are based on our interestsor find like-minded people unless we already have connections in that community or manually find one from social media. What if we don’t have connections in that community and can’t find those events? </p>

          <h2>Attendees</h2>
          <p>The main page of the app will provide suggestions of events that are held nearby. The events that shows up will be based on the attendees location and interest that are selected by them in their profile. Attendees can choose which event to attend.

          <h2>Host</h2>
          <p>You don’t need to worry about the safety of having strangers come to your event.You will still have complete control on who can come and who can’t. The exact locationof the event will not be made available unless you as the host approves the attendee’s request to attend. Once an attendee is interested in your event, you can either accept or deny their request to come to your event much like a reverse invitation. If you accept their request, the location of the event will show in the ‘Event Profile’ and a private messaging feature will be made available for you and the attendee to discuss more detailed information such as security code. Hosts can add tags (interests) to their event to be discovered by attendees. 
</p>

			<div id="attendees">
          <h2>Public Events</h2>
          <p>Hosts can also advertise a public event in which people are expected to come without the need to be approved. An example of these events may include festivals, concerts and public competitions. All you need to do is check attend and you’re ready to go!
